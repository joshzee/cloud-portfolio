I’ve just passed the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner CLF-C02 exam, my first official cloud certificate. I want to start off with I’m not a complete AWS/Cloud newbie. I’ve worked with various services across the different roles I’ve had over my 12+ year tech career. 

For instance, my current position sees me using DynomoDB, S3 and Cloudwatch daily, which were all setup prior to me joining the company, though learning the architecture came quite naturally, including how and why the Lambda functions were called. 

I’ve migrated a large WP Multisite site to AWS, which, of course, did come with it’s frustration points and I’ve also been an administrator for a bunch of EC2 instances, making sure the bills stayed low. Though with this said, I haven’t actually created and deployed a Web App (or Website in this example) completely on my own.

Coming across [cloudresumechallenge.com](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/) was a nice surprise. A real-world scenario that involved coding, hosting, security, a NoSQL Database, API Gateway with Lambda, Tests, Git and CI/CD using Github Actions. So now, as I finish off my first blog post around this use case of AWS and extremely justifiable use of my time, I wish myself good luck and godspeed.

**Quick Note**: I’ll also be using this space, when I can, to show other pieces of work, whether that be DevOps related, Python/Flask projects or anything that falls in the realm of ‘can I get this done in a reasonable amount of time outside of work hours’.
